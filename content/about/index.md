<p class="large">I am Jitachi, a product designer made of curiosity, stubbornness, and a hint of foolishness, per Professor Utonium's words.</p>

I grew up with ultra strong and relentless kids traveling on clouds with monkey tails that would make them go nuts. Of course I had a great example of what was expected from me.

I had to ~~go monkey nuts~~ be great.
