##### APR Engine (ECU) Tune Stage 1

The _easiest_ way to get more power. If I could only do one mod, this would be it. The APR Engine tune takes your car from 220HP to 316HP (!) which you might think "is not that much" but with this car weighting a bit over 1 ton (1,360 KG)... it's fun.

##### APR Transmission (TCU) Tune Stage 1

Once you change your engine tune, it's better if you also change how the shifts are done. So your car adjusts how shifts are thrown taking in consideration the updated engine instructions.
