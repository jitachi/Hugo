I like to observe, absorb, take apart, and remix. Alter the everyday by creating things for it. and have fun while at it. I'm a designer who's been around for 12-14 years, adding bits and bytes to the internet. I live in Guadalajara, MÃ©xico. I'm the design department at Railway, commonly called "Founding Designer." I like working on developer tools; I have wanted to work with computers since I was a kid, make them beep and bop.

## Heading 2 - This is a heading 2
Before Railway, I worked at Kong, Inc, a company that powers a big chunk of the interwebs, way back when it was called Mashape. Around 2014 and until 2019, when it was a medium-sized unstoppable force. It was fun to design software for enterprises, from developer portals and documentation to analytics and visual architecture tooling.
