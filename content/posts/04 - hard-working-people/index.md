As you could imagine, I’m 37 and I don’t have that many friends. The majority of my life orbits around my personal development and work.

I strive for greatness and look for people who do the same. I can’t get along with somebody “just because”, I need to see effort, I need to see pain to respect them. I tend to be uninterested in people who only glides through life and look for the easiest path. 

I don’t think I speak to any of my high school acquaintances because they didn’t choose a harder life. Most of the people I respect, admire, and keep talking I met them at work.

## Coworkers
I haaaate when people just want to do small talk to get along with one, and that somehow allows them to not put much effort. Like if we two get along you would like me, even if I don’t put the same effort as you. Bullshit. People who spends their work time being social, participating in threads here and there while the work is low quality pisses me off.

Talk to me through your work. Make me look. I’m not going to listen to you until you’ve proven your worth my time by showing the effort you put into making things or a particular activity, whatever this is.
