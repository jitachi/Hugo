Spacing is used in visual design to create visual relationships and hierarchy. Think of space as the “empty” space you leave between one note and the next one to form rhythm.

Have you noticed how the horizontal space between characters (tracking) is smaller than the blank space we put between “groups” of letter we call words, and how that space is smaller than the vertical space between vertical lines? So now we have lines.

And of course, among paragraphs, we have a bigger spacing. You just noticed how empty space can help us see words, lines of text, and paragraphs. The smallest space created the atomic relationship, a word, and as the “size of the complexity” increased, also the space.

It’s the same thing with interfaces.

But Jitachi, there’s an infinite vast of numbers I could use—thankfully, the international association of the internet standards, totally not made up, decided by committee that decent people on earth only use these values:

4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, and 256.

Now we’ve reduced the set
