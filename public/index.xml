      <description>I am Jitachi, a product designer made of curiosity, stubbornness, and a hint of foolishness, per Professor Utonium&#39;s words.
I grew up with ultra strong and relentless kids traveling on clouds with monkey tails that would make them go nuts. Of course I had a great example of what was expected from me.
I had to go monkey nuts be great.
