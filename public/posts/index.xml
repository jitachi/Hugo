      <description>At Railway, we have the tradition of making a location-specific artwork for every trip. In the past, we have visited Hawaii, Dubai, Bali, New Orleans, New Buffalo, La Palma (Spain), Lisbon, and for this last edition, we visited Mexico City.
The artwork formula is simple, picture the Railway train arriving to the retreat location. Ideally, use a recognizable monument and shove a train.
For Mexico City, I chose the Angel de la Independencia as the center piece of the artwork.</description>

      <description>Spacing is used in visual design to create visual relationships and hierarchy. Think of space as the “empty” space you leave between one note and the next one to form rhythm.
Have you noticed how the horizontal space between characters (tracking) is smaller than the blank space we put between “groups” of letter we call words, and how that space is smaller than the vertical space between vertical lines? So now we have lines.</description>
